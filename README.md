This is just a simple multiplayer web browser game using canvas and websockets. Client is written in javascript, server
is written in Go.

The game supports up to 4 players, but does not handle disconnections. So, it will only work for the first 4 players to
connect and will break when a 5th player tries to connect.

This is part of a hobby project of mine so the bugs will eventually be fixed later but there aren't any plans to fix yet.

Credit for the game idea goes to Edward Herbert on youtube; I only take credit for the multiplayer element.
